# ReEarth

Repo called that because we made this before coming up with a name lol  
our actual project Name is ReEarth

**Introduction**

A marketplace where people can sell / giveaway recycled items for free or for a price.  The seller can easily sell their recycled items compared to just throwing them away and the buyers can benefit from a platform that specializes in recycled items.  The sellers could be people that are too lazy to recycle and the buyers could consist of people looking for recycled items such  as NGOs, recycling centers, nature clubs from universities / schools and people who are just enthusiastic in recycling lowering the barrier of entry for people to start recycling
